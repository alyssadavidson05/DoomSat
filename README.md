# DoomSat
DoomSat is a CubeSat payload experiment that runs the classic game Doom autonomously in space using the ViZDoom engine. The project evaluates algorithms for execution efficiency, memory usage, and resilience under the constraints of spacecraft hardware, while also exploring the effects of cosmic bit flips on gameplay performance.
